# E-Commerce Sales Analysis

## Project Description

This repository contains a data analysis project designed to demonstrate a complete, albeit simplified, data processing workflow. The project utilizes Python for the programmatic generation of a sample dataset, subsequent analysis, and the visualization of key findings derived from the data.

## Project Components

The project is comprised of the following functional components:

1.  **Data Generation**: A script that produces a synthetic dataset representing e-commerce transactions. The output is a CSV file containing fields such as OrderID, Date, Product, Quantity, and Price.
2.  **Data Analysis**: The core logic, which employs the Pandas library to perform data manipulation, aggregation, and statistical analysis to extract meaningful insights.
3.  **Data Visualization**: The generation of graphical representations of the analysis results, specifically illustrating sales trends over time and sales performance by product. These visualizations are created using the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries.

## Technologies Employed

* **Core Language**: Python
* **Data Manipulation**: Pandas
* **Numerical Computation**: NumPy
* **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Auxiliary Component**: A basic C++ program is included to illustrate a potential multi-language project structure.

## Instructions for Use

To replicate the analysis, please follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository**: First, clone the repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/e-commerce-sales-analysis.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/e-commerce-sales-analysis.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to Directory**: Change into the project's root directory.
    ```bash
    cd e-commerce-sales-analysis
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies**: Install the required Python libraries via pip.
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
    ```
4.  **Execute Script**: Run the main analysis script from the terminal.
    ```bash
    python analyze.py
    ```

Executing the script will produce the `ecommerce_data.csv` file in the project directory, along with two image files: `sales_over_time.png` and `sales_by_product.png`.

## Generated Visualizations

The following images are representative of the output generated by the script. To display them in the repository, they must be committed after their creation.
